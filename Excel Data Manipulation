First created a file 'questions' with columns "q#", "Question" and "Question Short" because the original questions were too long to use in dashboards.
  - This is a way to make the dashboard cleaner and still understand what each rating relates to.
  - Renamed "q26" to "q0" and moved it above "q1" because this is our Likelihood to Recommend Score, which will be one of the main highlights in the dashboard.

Then, cleaned the original file. Since it is a file with few rows, I will keep using excel for some data cleaning and manipulation:
  - First, removed column "language" as it is not relevant for the analysis.
  - Renamed column "q26" to "q0" and moved to the left of "q1" - similar to what had been done in the file 'questions'.
  - Saw that column "age" includes values '1' and '2' but we cannot have respondents with this age so these should be cleaned. These will be renamed to 'Unknown'.
  - Created a new column "age group" to group different age groups: 'less than 20', '20 to 29', '30 to 39' and '40 or more' and 'Unknown'
      =IF(D2="Unknown";D2;IF(D2<20;"less than 20";IF(D2<30;"20 to 29";IF(D2<40;"30 to 39";"40 or more"))))

Now that the data is clean, we can separate this file into 2 separate files: 'select_responses' and 'respondents'
  - 'respondents' - this file only contains our Key that will let us join both tables in the data model and the respondent's information
  - saved new file 'respondents' as a csv with the columns
    user_id; platform; gender; age; age group
 
  - 'select_responses' - this file only contains our Key that will let us join both tables in the data model and the responses for each of the questions
  - saved the new file 'select_responses' as a csv with the columns
    user_id; q0; q1; q2; q3; q4; q5; q6; q7; q8; q9; q10; q11; q12; q13; q14; q15; q16; q17; q18; q19; q20; q21; q22; q23; q24; q25; 
  - This file will let us create a parameter to toggle between the different questions and see all info related to that

We still need a file where we will be able to compare all questions against each other so we need to create 'response_comparison'
  - saved new file 'response_comparison' as a csv with the columns
    user_id; response; question

We are now ready to import our files into our BI tool and build the data model and dashboard.

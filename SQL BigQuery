Download file from Kaggle - Website Satisfaction Survey https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hayriyigit/website-satisfaction-survey
Import CSV file into BigQuery

Split the file into 2 tables: survey_responses and respondents

-- Create table for survey responses
-- user_id is our key that will let us join both tables in the same data model
-- q1 through q26 are the survey responses
CREATE TABLE website_satisfaction_survey.survey_responses AS
SELECT 
  user_id,
  q1,
  q2,
  q3,
  q4,
  q5,
  q6,
  q7,

  q10,
  q11,
  q12,
  q13,
  q14,
  q15,

  q17,

  q20,

FROM `website_satisfaction_survey.Survey`;

-- Create table for respondents
-- user_id is key that will let us join both tables in the same data model
-- platform, gender and age is the information we have about respondents
-- group age by groups "Less than 20", "20 to 29", "30 to 39" and "40 or More"
CREATE TABLE website_satisfaction_survey.respondents AS
SELECT 
  user_id,
  platform,
  gender,
  age,
  CASE 
    WHEN age <= 19 THEN 'less than 20'
    WHEN age >= 20 AND age < 30 THEN '20 to 29'
    WHEN age >= 30 AND age < 40 THEN '30 to 39'
    ELSE '40 or more'
  END AS age_group
FROM website_satisfaction_survey.Survey;

Exported both the new tables into csv so that we can then import in BI tools to build dashboard.
